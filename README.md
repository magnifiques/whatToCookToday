## üì¶ Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/magnifiques/WhatToCookToday.git
   cd WhatToCookToday
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   DRIVE_FILE_ID=your_google_drive_file_id_here
   ```

4. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   The app will be available at `http://localhost:7860`

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: OpenAI API key for recipe generation
- `DRIVE_FILE_ID`: Google Drive file ID containing the ChromaDB database

### ChromaDB Setup

The application automatically downloads and extracts the ChromaDB from Google Drive on first run. The database contains pre-indexed recipe data for fast retrieval.

## üí° Usage Examples

**Simple ingredients:**
```
"I have tomato and pasta, what should I cook?"
```

**Multiple ingredients:**
```
"I have chicken, potatoes, and onions, what can I make?"
```

**Pantry staples:**
```
"I have rice and beans, any recipe ideas?"
```
